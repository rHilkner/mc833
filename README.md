# mc833proj1

Project from the discipline Computer Network - MC833 (State University of Campinas - UNICAMP) with the objective of building a TCP based server that holds a (fake-ish) database of disciplines of our university and that may exchange messages with some client that can make requests about any disciplines (such as: getting a list of every disciplines with its titles; getting a list of all information available of every discipline; getting a discipline title, menu, schedule or commentary).

You may read more complete information about the server in the pdf file that we may or may not have uploaded here :v
